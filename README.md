## Remarks
Components is just a dummy folder with prior references and calculations.  
The actual ones are:  
1) main.py - controls the manipulation of variables to be rendered  
2) VLECalculations.py - handles the VLE calculations at set params [n,T,P,comp,z]  
3) plot.py - in charge of plotting the various graphs  
4) static\app.js - in charge of animations
